        <p>After months of procrastination, I finally decide to take part in a game jam (just 2 weeks before my end semester exams), and registered my name for the WGJ19 and got ready for the theme release.</p>
<p>Exactly at 10:30pm on 16th November, the theme for the game jam – “Attraction” – was released.</p>
<p>Spent a good day to jot down all interpretations of the them that my mind could build.</p>
<p>A day down my notes showed, gravity and physics, and couples and theme parks. Being an engineer (in works), physics made the most sense. So with around 24hrs spent, I started prototyping my best ideas in Unity for the feasibility and the fun. I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prototype 1: Use gravity to guide the ball to final. Insanely difficult that one. So I just dumped it.</li>
<li>Prototype 2: Control a star and eat other stars. Just didn’t seem right. SCRAP!</li>
<li>Prototype 3: Have gravity pull a lot of balls towards our guy, who had to evade the balls using the maze walls. Now here I found how fun the attraction thing was. Balls were simply orbiting the player till they hit. I had to let go, because I couldn’t think any further ways to make it fun and as is it wasn’t very involving.</li>
<li>Prototype 4: A platformer where the player stuck to the platform of his/her choice. After a while for buggy platforming and sliding, I realized I could combine the orbiting of the previous prototype and this platforms idea. And voila – Neo was born!</li>
</ul>
<p>Game development is an iterative process. So the answer is always quick prototyping.</p>
<p>So far so good, it was Tuesday already, and submission was on Thursday. I started scripting the exact mechanics and behaviors of the game, along with working on the art. (Not my best domain)</p>
<p>I came up with a magnet sprite in GIMP which was not a lot of work just very simple edits, some artistic flare. <em>Ok, fine. It was an orange cirle.</em>. Now, for the name, I thought of MagBall, AttractBall, Neodynium Jump - this is where <em>Neo</em> later came from.</p>
<p>Finally with the core game ready, one day prior to submission I wanted to make a logo for the game. So I tried making a MagBall logo using GIMP. It was too tedious and I was too tired. So I just picked up the magnet sprite that I made, scaled it up, and copied it to make the ‘m’ and then realized I wouldn&rsquo;t last and that <em>Neo</em> might be easer. Cue the ‘e’ and two magnets to make ‘o’ and the all that remained was a bit of cut and paint-bucket. Just had to rename the game, that’s all. (Creativity is born from constraints, yada yada yada)</p>
<p>By this time the core behaviour, UI, Menus, and save-game system was in the game. Just for the looks, I added a Trail Renderer to the ball. Still found something to be lacking. It was too silent…</p>
<p>Went up to <a href="https://incompetech.com/">Kevin MacLeod’s website</a> and downloaded the most fitting piece of classical music I could think of.</p>
<p>And finally, Neo was ready to publish on <a href="https://www.itch.io">itch.io</a></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://kidrigger.itch.io/neo">product</a>. Playable on browsers, or downloadable for Mac and Windows</p>
