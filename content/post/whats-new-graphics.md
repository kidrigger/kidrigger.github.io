Alright, this is what’s new in my life. I’ve found my area of passion in games, and exactly in rendering in games.

I’m learning OpenGL, and it’s insane what it can let me do. (I’m not good enough yet, but with practice, THERE IS SO MUCH TO LEARN – AAAAAH)

So, I started with  learnopengl.com and started making a trial monolithic C++ main file.

There’s one thing watching a demo using Sponza, and there’s one where you’re watching your own code rendering it. (Without any nice stuff. Just simple Albedo, Normal and Specular)

Now, time to actually build a framework to modify. A 600 line main is not feasible anymore. To the design board we go!
