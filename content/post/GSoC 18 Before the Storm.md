# Beginning

I was interested in game development since 9th grade, which was my main motivation for learning C++. As I got more into development, I started getting interested in game engines and tried creating my own using Allegro for rendering amd resource handling. Inferno, if you’re interested.
Finally I got my hands on the Quake 2 engine source code (Thanks id-Software) and started reading the source, and that’s when I came across Godot.
This was around February this year. I installed it on my computer and tried to learn how to make games in it. (after a long time of Unity, this was a welcome change)

# Waiting for Godot

Now on 16th February a good friend of mine told me that the list of Google Summer of Code organizations was out, and that it had “some Game Development org in it” (His words)
Turned out, Godot was a GSoC org! Just the right push to make me start working on Godot. Joined IRC, cloned the repository and started picking out the label:'junior-jobs' issues and solving one of them. I’ll have more about how I started working on Godot later, it was a learning experience that deserves it’s own space.

# Brainstorming for GSoC

Godot's community came with a list of ideas for GSoC projects. Me being quite new to the engine itself, I found that it was easier to pick up one of their suggested projects and build my own thoughts above and do some groundwork as compared to coming up with a, idea myself. Two top contenders? GDScript Code Formatter and GDNative Plugin for Video Decoding. The GDNative plugin felt like something more important and useful for Godot right now. (It will be nice to have vs We should have it) So I dived into the code and kept tracking and asking people who wrote it about how to go about my project. It was just that interesting.

Over time after quite some discussions with Thomas Herzog about GDNative and how it works, as well as Hein-Pieter van Braam about what libraries, and approach to be used in the project.
Proposal

Proposal submission was on 27th March, by when, I had gone through multiple iterations of my drafts with a lot of help from my mentors, especially Hein-Pieter van Braam (TMM).

Finally I submitted my proposal.
