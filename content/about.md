Since you're here, this is the time for me to introduce myself.  

My name is **Anish Bhobe** and as you can guess from my projects, I'm a huge enthusiast of computer graphics and C++ in game development.

I at the moment of writing I have long (2020) received a Bachelor of Engineering Degree from **Birla Institute of Science and Technology, Pilani**.  
I've worked at **Microsoft R&D** (Hyderabad, India) for 1 full year. (2020-2021)  
And I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. Track (5 yrs Masters + Ph.D; tentative 2021-2026) at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.  

When my day's classes is over - you'll find me postured in front of ~~elven~~ C++, C# and Rust scripts and tabs full of articles on how to implement the techniques I feel like adding.  
Needless to say, I love videogames - the immersive worlds that are realistic, artistic or both (which I absolutely want to be responsible in bringing to life) and the amazing narratives and stories that they deliver.

Now that I've decided to devote my life to research, my goal is to unify hardware in a way that allows easy development for GPUs/Co-processors etc. so that some day we can write a single model/program/specification that deploys on any hardware and _just works_.
